# First steps

This page contains some examples to teach you about the fundamentals of Deno.

This document assumes that you have some prior knowledge of JavaScript,
especially about `async`/`await`. If you have no prior knowledge of JavaScript,
you might want to follow a guide
[on the basics of JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)
before attempting to start with Deno.
